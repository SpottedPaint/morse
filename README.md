Why ?

I'm learning some ruby so I can be like all the cool kids :). Also wanted to do some cucumber/gherkin.

ruby -rubygems wwwroot/app.rb

###TODO
* sort out whitespace so morse can be input better and words in morse strings are separated when entered via input box
* add prosigns? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code

This probably only works in 1.9.x as it uses require_relative that seemed improvement on ../ style paths

Y'all can see it via heroku at http://morse.adamwilson.info
